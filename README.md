# Travel Nest Coding Test - Command Line Script

This is my first time doing Web Scrapping, after taking the code out of symfony I had to write my own scraper functions.

There is a bug where the Amenities don't come through correctly 100% of the time, but I can't figure out why.  They appear to return as a 
single node in some cases and in multiple nodes in others.
